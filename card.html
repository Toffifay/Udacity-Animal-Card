			<p>Some Moon Jellyfish are capable of Bioluminescence which means that they can glow in the dark</p> 
			<p>They can survive in any temperature of water, but they prefer to stay close to the surface after hatching from the ocean floor to feed on plankton sized animals</p>
			<p>Even though Jellyfish are known to just float by the current's whim, Moon Jellyfish actually have coordinated movement that is guided by a primary sensory like you and I that respond to outside stimulus like Light and Touch</p>
